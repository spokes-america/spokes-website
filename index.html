     	<p style="line-height:1.3;">For the summer of 2017, a team of 8 MIT and Harvard students will bike across the United States in collaboration
           with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a> and <a href="http://teachforamerica.org">Teach for America</a> as part of an effort to rethink STEM
        education. As we go, we will stop at a dozen
        schools, libraries, and camps throughout the country to hold <em>learning festivals</em>. At each school, we will teach hands-on,
         project-based classes based on our passions in STEM.

	          <p>I’m Matisse Peppet, a freshman at MIT studying pure mathematics with an interest in art and philosophy. I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, with a strong appreciation for the Midwest — I am enamored of America, and I’m so excited to see this country and feel its pulse this summer. Teaching, and in particular, teaching math is a joyful endeavor for me, and I’m interested in mathematics education and educational policy. I’m psyched to get kids psyched about STEM with Spokes!</p>

	          <p>Hi, I’m Masha, a senior at MIT. I've lived all over the place, including California, Virginia, New Jersey, Germany, and Russia. But am so excited to see more of the US this summer. I'm studying Computer science and molecular biology at MIT, and love to learn about anything and everything! I am excited to share this passion with everyone our way this summer. In my free time, I can be found doodling in my notebooks and drinking tea. I also really enjoy climbing, hiking, and being active. Next year, I'll be working for Google in Mountain View, CA. </p>

	          <p>I’m Olivia, a MIT student, and Cambridge native. I enjoy biking (thankfully) and pretty much any other form of outdoor exercise. I also like to cook; making yummy creations out of whatever I have left in the fridge is my specialty. As a freshman at MIT, I am not quite sure what I am going to study, but I know I will be able to find something I am passionate about among all the amazing opportunities that MIT feeds me. For starters, I’m excited for the opportunity to bike and teach across America!</p>

	          <p>Hi everyone, my name is Javier (got it for my birthday!) but you can call me Javi. I was born at a very young age in the sunny land of California, but I weathered the cold East Coast to study Neurobiology at Harvard (currently a senior). But that's not enough for me! I can't wait to ride on the open roads of America this summer with Spokes! Good challenges, great teammates, grand landscapes - what more can one ask for? Also, as a proud supporter of STEM education and potentially aspiring educator, I welcome this opportunity to teach with delighted gratitude and ignited attitude.</p>

	          <p>Hi! I’m Caity, a sophomore at MIT double majoring in physics and electrical engineering. I am so excited to be doing Spokes this summer! I think that spreading interest in STEM, especially to those who may not be able to otherwise experience a lot of science and technology in their schools, is one of the best ways to inspire the next generation to do great things and prepare them for the future. Aside from being able to bike across the country, I am so grateful to be biking with such a great team this summer. I can’t wait to get out on the open road and begin teaching the curriculum. See you in San Francisco!</p>

	          <p>Hi! I’m a sophomore at MIT studying Physics and Music and occasionally Chemistry. I grew up at the base of the foothills in beautiful Denver, Colorado. I love all things STEM, especially fields at the intersection of two disciplines, ie acoustics! I transferred to MIT after a semester at a liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon and have a deep love of both science and humanities. I’m beyond excited to have the opportunity to bike across the United States and teach through Spokes this Summer!</p>

	          <p>Hi, I'm Margalit and I'm a Junior at MIT studying Math with Computer Science. I grew up in Newton, MA and enjoy going on long bike trips with my family or mountain biking at my summer camp in Colorado. I love teaching math and computer science, and traveled to Israel last year for a month to teach computer architecture to middle schoolers.  In my free time, I like to hike, run, and work at a biology lab.</p>

I'm originally from California, so I'm a little ways away from home here at MIT in Boston, MA, but the crazy science that's happening around me all the time makes it completely worth it. With the help of science, my dream for the future is to design robots for all sorts of applications - from submarine robots to surgical robots to space robots! I'm stoked to be able to ride a bike across America and teach tons of aspiring scientists and engineers!</p>

     	<div id="math"><h3>Games, Games, and More Games: Math and Strategy</h3>
     	<p>In this workshop, students will play various games and puzzles to explore mathematical concepts such as probability and combinatorics. Students will probe at questions of probability and combinatorics through play with tilings and colorings. Also, physical games will be used as tools for exploration, conjecture, and as a means to facilitate engagement of different age levels in the classroom. Concepts will included pattern puzzles, building blocks, and the game SET as part of our workshop. </p></div></div>
     	<div class="col-md-3" ><!-- <img src="img/classes/dna.jpg"> --><div id="sports"><h3>Neuropsych Seminar</h3><p>In this sensational workshop, students will explore all five of their senses and learn about the complexity behind how the brain interprets sensory information! The first half of the workshop will be focused on many small but fun activities that will highlight the subconscious tendencies of our human brain. Once the students have a better understanding of how our senses work, in the second half of the workshop we will take a deeper step and delve into a dissection of a Cow’s Eye Ball, where we will examine the anatomy of a sensory organ. Here’s to hoping all of this crazy brain stuff will make a lot more sense after this workshop!

     	<div id="circuits"><h3>How Computers Work: Building Circuits</h3>
     	<p>Ever wondered how a computer solves math problems? Or how it represents numbers and words in a bunch of 1s and 0s? In this workshop, you will learn about binary, the language of computers. We’ll talk about the basic building blocks of computers, transistors and logic gates, and see how these elements come together to form a computers. Then you’ll get to use those gates to build circuits on breadboards that can add numbers for you - and maybe even do more!

You’ll have an opportunity to build your own homemade speaker, motor, and/or catapult. After learning the basics of how these three pieces of technology work, there will be a competition for whoever’s catapult launches the farthest, (fabulous prizes included)! By working on these projects, you will gain the skills to conceptually understand and physically create your own physics experiments!
